Just a little game to test out a dialog object I made for another project.

Basically this little game will flow like this:
-Open the store:
  1. Brew Coffie.
  2. Turn on the Lights.
  3. Unlock the front door.
-People mill about the store until they come up to the register to:
  1. Buy things.
  2. Ask a question.
-Close up the store:
  1. Throw out the coffie.
  2. Set the alarm.
  3. Turn off the lights.
  4. Lock the front door.
  
So that is pretty much it. The game progresses through the days as you build up hearts with people as you answer their questions corectly and just try to answer their questions the way you need to to not be a jerk.
