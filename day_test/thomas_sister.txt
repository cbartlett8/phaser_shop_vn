Sister?
{questioning}
#Marion
Hmm...sorry I'm busy at the moment, could you come back later?
{apathy}
#*
Oh sister I truly would love to allow you to wollow away but 
the current situation requires your participation.
{snarky}
#Marion
Is this about the commotion outside? Burglers or some such?
#*
No dear, it seems as though it is of a Apocolyptic scale of situation, therefore
I need your help and quickly!
{desperate}
#Marion
...So this involves the demi-lord?
{question}
#*
Yes, but he's not the main concern here, it the man who is trying to-
#Marion
I can't help you.
{depression}
#*
I beg your pardon
{anger}
#Marion
I'm sorry but I can't help you. I can't fight those things again.
#*
Oh come now Mari-
#Marion
My name isn't Marion anymore I told you all that before, Marion is a coward's name.
{AngryDepressed}
#*
So where are we then?
{idle}
#Marion
I simply can't.
{depressed}
#*
But you must-
#Marion
Look at these hands!
This is from just discussing these things, these...
[Marion_Shaking_hands]
#Marion
STUPID RESPONSIABILITES!!!
[Marion_Room]
{angry}

Marion...
{sad}
#Marion
Responsiabilities, that what father said about the mission, 
our responsibilities.
{sad}
#*
Marion?
#Marion
Stop saying that.
{idle}
#*
Mari-?
#Marion
Stop saying that name!
{angry}
#Marion
I'm not Marion! My name is Lady Magical: Defender of Love. 
[FullScreenOfMarion?]
#Marion
I'm someone who doesn't run away.
[marion_room]
{sad}
#*
I understand Ma- I mean Lady Magical. With your permission I shall take my leave.
{Idle_nothing_nothing_}
#Marion
Wait, what  is it I "can" help you with?
{depressed}
#*
Well if you wish to be a help I need something that can distract Mother 
enough to take her key to Father's room.
{happy}
#Marion (Lady Magical)
Oh thats easy, go to the cellar and bring her a bottle of Shato Sequine 
wine. She couldn't possibly refuse a request then.
{happy}
#Player
The Cellar? Fine I shall go. Have a good life or whatnot Lady Magical.
